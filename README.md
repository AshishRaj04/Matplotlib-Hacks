# Machine Learning Plots with Matplotlib

Welcome to the Machine Learning Plots repository! This repository contains a collection of essential machine learning plots created using Matplotlib. These plots are intended to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners visualize various aspects of their models and data, including decision boundaries, feature engineering, and more.

## Introduction

Visualizing different aspects of your machine learning models and data is crucial for understanding their behavior and performance. This repository provides various plots implemented using Matplotlib to aid in this process. Whether you're looking to visualize the decision boundary of a classifier, understand feature importance, or inspect the correlation between features, you'll find useful plots here.

## Installation

To use the plots in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
``` bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Usage

Each plot is provided as a separate Python script in the plots directory. You can import these scripts into your own projects or run them independently. Below is an example of how to use the decision_boundary_plot.py script:
```python
from plots.decision_boundary_plot import plot_decision_boundary
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Generate synthetic data
X, y = make_classification(n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_informative=2, random_state=1, n_clusters_per_class=1)

# Fit a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Plot the decision boundary
plot_decision_boundary(model, X, y)
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new plot to add or improvements to existing ones, please open a pull request. Ensure that your code follows the style of the existing scripts and includes appropriate documentation.
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
5. Open a pull request.
